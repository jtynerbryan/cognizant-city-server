# City ID Server

### I turned the JSON file you provided me with into a simple server using https://github.com/typicode/json-server
### After forking, cloning and cd'ing into this repo, follow these steps to get the server running:
1. Unzip the json file (it has been minimally modified)
2. install JSON Server package with `npm install -g json-server`
3. start the server with `json-server --watch db.json`
4. stop the server with `ctrl+c`
### That's it! Check out https://github.com/typicode/json-server for more information
